Verses of Refuge and Bodhichitta
by Śākyaśrībhadra

dro nam dral dö sampa yi
Motivated by the wish to free all beings,
sangye chö dang gendün la
Continually, I shall take refuge
changchub nyingpor chi kyi bar
In the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha,
takpar dak ni kyab su chi
Till the essence of enlightenment is reached.

sherab nying tsé dang chepé
With wisdom and with heartfelt love,
tsönpé semchen döndu dak
Diligently, for the sake of sentient beings,
sangye dündu né gyi né
I shall place myself before the buddhas,
dzokpé changchub semkyé do
And generate the perfect mind of bodhicitta.

Composed by the great Kashmiri paṇḍita Śākyaśrībhadra.1
